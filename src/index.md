### **Full Stack Engineer, proficient in wasting time**

Skills
------

I overall have a lot of experience with tech, computers and programming.
And I've had an interest in those fields for a very very long time now.

I've always liked how web development works, and so I've stayed pretty
true to it and much prefer working in it in most cases.

 - Python and other higher level languages
 - Some low level languages (C, Go and more)
 - Shell scripting (Bash, Bourne Shell/POSIX)
 - JavaScript, NodeJS, Electron and any web development

Projects
--------

I am overall very bad at finishing projects so I don't have much to put
onto here, however I do still have something!
