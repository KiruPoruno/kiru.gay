Hello World.
------------

And welcome to my blog, this is the first post I'll be making but
hopefully not the last, it took me some time to actually get bothered
enough to implement a blogging feature for my site generator
([ksg](https://github.com/KiruPoruno/kiru.gay)), but at last, it can
generate fully static blog posts, and everything, it even sorts them,
it's actually really nice. It makes it very neat and easy to make posts
with minimal effort.

And in the future I always have the Markdown version as it's all written
in Markdown then converted with ksg. Very neat!

**What's this blog about?**

This whole blog serves as a place for me to rant, express various
opinions, some rather interesting, others not so much, whether you'll
actually enjoy them is up to you.

Everything I'll ever post on here is fully my opinion and I won't ever
be endorsed to say anything about anything. So feel free to assume that
everything on here is my opinion, because it is :)

**Finishing touches**

I am not all finished with the whole blog feature, and I'll probably
implement an RSS feed at some point when I feel like it, however given
that these are my own blog posts I won't be the one who needs to read
them, besides this I might add more metadata and other fun stuff.

But all in all, my blogs page is finally functioning to a degree where
I'm satisfied to actually post stuff... So feel free to stick around and
do whatever, read my posts, ignore my posts, stalk my posts, whatever
you feel like....
